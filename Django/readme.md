<h1 align="center">Django</h1>

## installation:
* creating a virtual enviroment<br>
we need to create virtual enviroment so that we can isolate our project from all other projects on the system
- windows
    * using python -
    `python -m venv projectone` : this create a virtual environment called projectone
    * activating virtual environment -
        `projectone\Scripts\activate`
    * deactivating a virtual environment: `deactivate`
<hr>

after the virtual environment is created we can install django inside the virtual environment by using pip:- 
`python -m pip install Django`
